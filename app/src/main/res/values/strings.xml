        A unique cooking utensil called a "cou-cou stick", or "fungi stick", is used in its preparation.
        A cou-cou stick is made of wood, and has a long, flat rectangular shape like a 1-foot-long (30 cm)
        miniature cricket bat. It is believed by Barbadians to be essential in stirring the cou-cou, as the
        dish takes on a firm texture and the cou-cou stick makes it easier to stir in a large pot.
